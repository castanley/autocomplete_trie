Design a service to autocomplete an account name, assuming account names are composed of all lower case English characters. In other words, given a collection of account names, and a prefix, return all matching account names in the dictionary that starts with the given prefix.

More specifically, implement the following functionality:
- Inserting a word into the data structure
- Checking if a word exists in the data structure
- Querying the data structure to determine the set of words which have a common prefix
